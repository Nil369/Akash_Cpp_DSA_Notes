### **Challenges for Students**

1. **Challenge 1: Arithmetic Operators**\
   Write a program that calculates the price of tea packs. A user enters the number of tea packs they want, and the price per pack. Apply a 10% tax to the total price and display the final cost.

2. **Challenge 2: Assignment Operators**\
   Create a program where the user inputs the number of tea bags they have. If the number is less than 20, give them 10 extra bags using the `+=` assignment operator. Display the updated total.

3. **Challenge 3: Relational and Logical Operators**\
   A tea subscription service offers a discount if the user buys more than 12 cups or if they are a member for more than a year. Write a program that checks if the user qualifies for a discount based on their input.

4. **Challenge 4: Bitwise Operators**\
   Write a program that uses bitwise AND (`&`) to check which tea types are in stock. The stock is encoded in an integer (1 for Green, 2 for Black, 4 for Oolong). Allow the user to check availability by inputting the tea type (1, 2, or 4), and display a message saying whether that tea is in stock or not.
