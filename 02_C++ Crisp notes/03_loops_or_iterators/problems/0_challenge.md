### **Challenges for Students**

1. **Challenge 1: While Loop**\
   Write a program that keeps asking the user to input the number of tea bags they have left. Stop when the number of bags is 0, and print a message that they are out of tea bags.

2. **Challenge 2: Do-While Loop**\
   Write a program that asks the user if they want to add more sugar to their tea. Keep asking until they respond with "enough." Use a `do-while` loop for this.

3. **Challenge 3: For Loop**\
   Create a program that prints the first 10 multiples of 2, representing the total tea bags required for making batches of tea.

4. **Challenge 4: Break and Continue**\
   Write a program that checks a list of tea types and serves tea for each type, except "Herbal Tea." If "Herbal Tea" is encountered, skip it using `continue`. If "No Tea" is encountered, stop the loop using `break`.

5. **Challenge 5: Nested Loops**\
   Write a program that displays a tea brewing schedule. For each day of the week (outer loop), brew 2 cups of tea for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (inner loop).
