# Task to learn loop in C++

## 1. While Loop
Challenge:
Write a program that keeps track of tea orders. Each time a cup of tea is made, decrease the number of cups remaining. The loop should run until all cups are served.

## 2. Do-While Loop
Challenge:
Create a program that asks the user if they want more tea. Keep asking them until they type "no" (case-insensitive), using a do-while loop.

## 3. For Loop
Challenge:
Write a program that prints the brewing instructions for making 5 cups of tea. The brewing process should be printed once for each cup using a for loop.

# 4. Break Keyword
Challenge:
Write a program that keeps serving tea until the user says theyâ€™ve had enough (input 'stop'). Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user types 'stop'.

# 5. Continue Keyword
Challenge:
Write a program that skips brewing green tea if the user dislikes it. Use a continue statement to skip over green tea but brew other types of tea in a list.

# 6. Nested Loops
Challenge:
Write a program that brews multiple cups of different types of tea. For each type of tea, brew 3 cups using a nested loop.
